sklearn library is used
In this project i have trained the model where in it would catagorize the Text passed by the user to respective catagory
Household,books,Clothing and accessories,Electronics are the catogories that the model has been trained
this project is made by extrating the data from kaggle a ecommerce data is used to train the model
The model is trained by using
 part1: MultinomialNB
 by importing,from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
 part2: RandomForestClassifier
 by importing,from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
 part3: LogisticRegression
 by importing,from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
steps involved
1.create a kaagle account and  download the token in the profile section of kaggle
2.upload that kaggle token to your collab notebook
and the proceed with the code


Thank you
